# Making-server-side-API-request-using-(axios, JSON, Node.js, Express.js)

In this project, I've harnessed the power of Axios and Express.js to craft a dynamic website suggesting diverse activities for tackling boredom. Users can refresh the page for fresh ideas, apply filters for specific activity types and participants, and even contribute their own suggestions. The site, designed with user-friendliness in mind, seamlessly combines server-side API requests with error handling expertise, ensuring a reliable experience. With a deep understanding of JSON responses, I've adeptly managed potential errors. The utilization of both GET and POST methods adds to the platform's interactivity.

To run this project
