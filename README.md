# Making-server-side-API-request-using-axios

In this project, I've used Axios and Express.js to create a dynamic website that suggests random activities to combat boredom. Users can refresh the page to discover new ideas or filter activities by type and participants. EJS templates ensure real-time updates on the frontend, and the site supports both GET and POST methods for interaction. It's a user-friendly platform that seamlessly integrates server-side API requests and user input to provide a diverse range of engaging options for beating boredom.
